This is a graduate course in the Department of Civil Engineering at UBC. I have served as the substitute lecturer and delivered in-class lectures and tutorials. The course focused on the fundamental analysis of simple structures subjected to dynamic loadings, vibration problems in structures, linear and nonlinear structural response of simple systems, and numerical methods for practical vibration analysis.
