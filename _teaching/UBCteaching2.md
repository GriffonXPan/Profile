This is a graduate course in the Department of Civil Engineering at UBC. I am a co-instructor for the course. I have co-designed and been co-teaching the course with Prof. Tony T.Y. Yang. The course focuses on the theory of structural dynamics and its implementation in the design of structures for seismic loads as outline in the National Building Code of Canada (NBCC). This course provides students with detailed understanding on the concepts of irregularity, ductility, redundancy, torsional effect, capacity design, quasi-static, modal and nonlinear analyses, and performance-based earthquake engineering.
