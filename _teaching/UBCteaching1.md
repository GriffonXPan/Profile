This is a 2nd year undergraduate core course in the Department of Civil Engineering at UBC. I am a co-instructor for the course. I have further developed and been co-teaching the course with Prof. Tony T.Y. Yang. As part of the course, students are trained to have a sound basis in structural engineering mechanics including stress-strain analysis, force deformation response, capacity of the elastic element including tension, compression (buckling and non-buckling), bending and combined loads. Students are divided into teams to design and analyze an 8-foot timber truss, and gain the experience of working in teams to construct and test the truss until failure. The course provides team-building and hands-on experience in applying structural engineering theories into practice.
