My area of teaching interests focuses on structural and earthquake engineering. Over the past couple of years, I have been actively engaged in teaching and tutoring graduate and undergraduate courses. The description of each course and my associated responsibilities are detailed below.

Jan 2020 - Present	Co-instructor/Substitute Lecturer, The University of British Columbia, Canada
 * CIVL 231 – Structural Mechanics: This is a 2nd year undergraduate core course in the Department of Civil Engineering at UBC. I have further developed and been co-teaching the course with Prof. Tony T.Y. Yang. As part of the course, students are trained to have a sound basis in structural engineering mechanics including stress-strain analysis, force deformation response, capacity of the elastic element including tension, compression (buckling and non-buckling), bending and combined loads. Students are divided into teams to design and analyze an 8-foot timber truss, and gain the experience of working in teams to construct and test the truss until failure. The course provides team-building and hands-on experience in applying structural engineering theories into practice.
 * CIVL 505 – Seismic Response of Structures: This is a graduate course in the Department of Civil Engineering at UBC. I have co-designed and been co-teaching the course with Prof. Tony T.Y. Yang. The course focuses on the theory of structural dynamics and its implementation in the design of structures for seismic loads as outline in the National Building Code of Canada (NBCC). This course provides students with detailed understanding on the concepts of irregularity, ductility, redundancy, torsional effect, capacity design, quasi-static, modal and nonlinear analyses, and performance-based earthquake engineering
 * CIVL 507 – Dynamics of Structures: This is a graduate course in the Department of Civil Engineering at UBC. I have served as the substitute lecturer and delivered in-class lectures and tutorials. The course focused on the fundamental analysis of simple structures subjected to dynamic loadings, vibration problems in structures, linear and nonlinear structural response of simple systems, and numerical methods for practical vibration analysis.


May 2018 – Dec 2022	Graduate Teaching Assistant, The University of British Columbia, Canada 
 * CIVL 511 Seismic Design of Steel Structures
 * CIVL 235 Engineering Surveying
 * CIVL 250 Engineering and Sustainable Development
